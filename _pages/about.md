<p style="margin-top: 1.2rem"> I'm a PhD student in Statistics and Machine Learning part of the <a href="https://www.statml.io">StatML CDT</a>. I work alongside Imperial's Cancer Research centre and develop statistical methods aimed at cancer diagnosis and prognosis. 

Broadly, I'm interested in:

 - Variational inference
 - High-dimensional statistics
 - Gaussian processes
 - Variable selection
