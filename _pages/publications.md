## Publications

Throughout my PhD I have published a number of papers in various journals and conferences. The main focus of my research has been on the development of novel methodologies for the analysis of complex data. Typically this involves the development of new algorithms and software tools which are then applied to real world data sets. The following is a list of my publications to date, also available on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.google_scholar_id }}).
