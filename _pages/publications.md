## Publications

Throughout my PhD I have completed a number of projects and published these in various journals and conferences. The main focus of my research has been on the development of novel methodologies for the analysis of large scale datasets. Typically this involves the development of new algorithms and software, which often give state of the art performance on a range of benchmark datasets.

The following is a list of my publications to date, also available on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.google_scholar_id }}).
