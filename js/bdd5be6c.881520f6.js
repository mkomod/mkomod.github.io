The project is opensource and has been growing rapidly over the last few years and there have been some great developments. Quasar relies heavily on VueJS in order to run so in order to get started it is worth getting to grips with Vue, from then on building Webpages is fairly trivial as there is a rich set of components to choose from and deployment is also relatively straightforward.\\n\\n\\n## Pages \\n\\nPages such as this one are written in markdown. They are then automatically bundled together with a small script, doing so keeps everything static and means no database is needed to fetch content. It also provides a simple mechanism to update site content.\\n\\n\\nThe following script is used bundle the markdown files and add them to the static files directory.\\n\\n\\n```\\nconst fs = require(\\"fs\\")\\nconst path = require(\\"path\\")\\n\\nconst markdown_dir = \\"./markdown\\"\\n\\nconst markdown_files = fs.readdirSync(markdown_dir)\\nconst index = []\\nconst articles = []\\nlet filePath\\n\\nmarkdown_files.forEach( (file, i) => {\\n\\n    filePath = path.join(__dirname, markdown_dir, file); \\n\\n    let content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, {encoding: \'utf-8\'})\\n\\n    date = file.slice(0,8)\\n    file = file.replace(/\\\\d{8}_/, \\"\\") \\n    file = file.replace(/\\\\.[^/.]+$/, \\"\\")\\n    // add articles to index\\n    index.push({\\n\\ttitle: file,\\n\\tid: i,\\n\\tbg: \\"statics/post_bg/\\" + date + \\".jpg\\",\\n\\tdate: {\\n\\t    day: date.slice(6,8),\\n\\t    month: date.slice(4,6),\\n\\t    year: date.slice(0,4)\\n\\t} \\n    })\\n\\n    // add content \\n    articles.push({\\n\\ttitle: file,\\n\\tcontent: content,\\n\\tbg: \\"statics/post_bg/\\" + date + \\".jpg\\"\\n    })\\n\\n})\\n\\nfs.writeFileSync(\'./src/statics/index.json\', JSON.stringify(index))\\nfs.writeFileSync(\'./src/statics/content.json\', JSON.stringify(articles))\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to run the script node is needed. Node is a Javascript runtime based off of Chromes V8 engine. It was created in order to run Javascript code on a local computer. Typically Javascript is only used to run webpages but with the introduction of node, javacript is being run on a local machine with access to streams such as stdin, stderr and so on. Node is typically used in conjunction with the development of webpages in order to host and serve the pages; a popular framework used to do so is Express. For my purposes I am using node in order to write the buffer to a new file know as `index.json` in turn the file is saved in the static directory of the webpage.\\n\\n\\n```\\n$ node buildcontent.js\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","bg":"statics/post_bg/20190522.jpg"},{"title":"Basics of WebRTC","content":"\\nWebRTC basics\\n===\\n\\nWebRTC allows for communication be it text, video or audio between peers and without the need for complex server infrastructure.\\n\\nWebRTC is natively available in:\\n - Modern Browsers\\n - Android\\n - iOS\\n\\n ## How WebRTC began\\n\\nGoogle bought GIPS which had developed components of RTC.

The reason venvs are worth using is that they save you from a huge headache in the future. Most of the time you\'ll end up doing multiple projects on a single machine and as your project evolves so do the requirements of that project, for instance at some point you may need an external package in order to add some functionality, installing the package into your global environment is a hassle free short term solution, issues start to arise when you have multiple projects relying on a single package. For instance you may have developed a django app when it was in version 2.1, and now want to develop another django app using version 2.2 which has some additional features and is the newest LTS release, when you go back to work on your old project you\'ll find some things have broken. Things can quickly get out of hand with multiple projects and multiple overlapping dependencies leading to long term issues that could take hours to fix.\\n\\nVirtual environments also allow a project to become more portable, by that I mean if you want to share your codebase along with the packages you are using with a friend or coworker you can quickly run the following command:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip freeze >> requirements.txt \\t\\n```\\n\\nthis adds a list of the packages you are using to a file called `\\"requirements.txt\\"` this can be added to the repository and then when it is shared only the relevant files will be downloaded, and not everything on your system. \\n\\nIn addition your requirements can be tracked via git and so you can have a log of all the changes you made when your project evolves.\\n\\n\\n## Using Virtual Environments\\n\\nAs of Python 3.6 the venv module is included as part of the standard library, previous to that you would have to use the virtualenv package available on pip.\\n\\nIn order to get started run:\\n\\n```\\n$ python -m venv env\\n```\\n\\nYou\'ve just created a virtual environment, before adding any packages make sure to run\\n\\n```\\n$ . env/bin/activate\\n```\\n\\nYou\'ll now see the following tag before on your terminal `(env) $ `\\n\\nFrom here onwards you\'re able to add pip packages as you do normally!\\n\\nIf you want to install packages from another repo you can run:\\n\\n```\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n","bg":"statics/post_bg/20190606.jpg"},{"title":"Making a Search Bar in 1 line of Bash","content":"Making a search bar in 1 line of Bash\\n===\\n\\nBash is a great tool if your looking to automate things or get things done efficiently. \\n\\nWhen working with BASH its important to keep in mind the UNIX philosophy \\n\\n> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.\\n> Write programs to work together.\\n> Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\\n\\nI say this because on most UNIX based or POSIX compliant systems such as MacOSX or mostly POSIX compliant system such as GNU/Linux there are a great number of tools that come with the OS, for instance you have well documented programs like: awk, sed, grep, head, tail, cat and so on which provide some great functionality.

It allows for a series of commands to be executed automatically without the need for user input. This  does sound really similar to a BASH Script; however the difference is that `make` allows you to specify multiple functions which run their own set of commands. For instance you may have an application you just developed which you want to run on another machine; therefore you would need a way to have instructions which install and unistall the app. Makefiles can do just that, you can have a command that can install the program and another that can uninstall it.\\n\\nThe advantage of `make` is that it gives the miscellaneous functions your program may need a definitive structure. Additionally those functions can exist in a single file. Furthermore makefiles offer portability as once you know how to write and use them you\'re open to a world of makefiles which are used unanimously by others (at least in the world of Linux users).\\n\\n## The Basics\\n\\nIn order to use `make` a `makefile` is needed this is a file a named `makefile`. `make` automatically reads a makefile and follows the instructions of the functions within it. There are ways to specify which function to follow but this is beyond the scope of this post.\\n\\nA basic example of a makefile is:\\n\\n```\\nhello_world:\\n\\t    echo \\"hello world\\"\\n\\t    @echo \\"hello world\\"\\n```\\n\\nWhen make is called the function is run and the commands are executed. In the case of commands with a `@` before them, they run silently i.e. the command is not printed only the commands output.\\n\\n## How I use make to build this site.\\n\\nI use `make` in order to build and deploy this website. Which is great because I have to run one command and all the hard work is done for me.\\n\\nThe makefile I use is:\\n\\n```{bash}\\nupdate:\\n\\t    @echo \\"bundling markdown\\"\\n\\t    node buildmd.js\\n\\t    @echo \\"building source\\"\\n\\t    quasar build\\n\\t    @echo \\"updating website\\"\\n\\t    rm -rf ../mkomod.github.io/*\\t# clears old dir\\n\\t    cp -r ./dist/spa/* ../mkomod.github.io # copies over files\\n\\t    cd ../mkomod.github.io; \\\\\\n\\t    git add . ;\\\\\\n\\t    git commit -m \\"automatic update\\"; \\\\\\n\\t    git push; # deploys to github\\n```\\n\\n## Closing remarks\\n\\nI hope you see how useful `make` is, the functionality it offers goes beyond the deployment of websites. I\'d recommend starting at makes man pages to learn more about it, there are some great tutorials around for further functionality but I hope what we talked about can get you started and save you time.
